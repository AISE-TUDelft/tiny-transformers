A rule of thumb for dealing with the literature is the following: scan about 10--20 contributions: read title, abstract, part of introduction and conclusions; categorize contribution; some of these are studied in more depth: completely read about 5 conference papers or equivalent (summarize contribution in own words); of which studied in-depth about 2 conference papers (the student is able to explain in detail and criticize contributions). This may result in 5--20 references, possibly even more if the project is a literature study.
