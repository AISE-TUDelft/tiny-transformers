\section{Methodology, Background, Problem Description}
Choose one that fits your research best:
\subsection{Methodology and/or background}
Typically in general research articles, the second section contains a description of the research methodology, explaining what you, the researcher, is doing to answer the research question(s), and why you have chosen this method.
For purely analytical work this is a description of the data collection or experimental setup on how to test the hypothesis, with a motivation.

In any case this section includes references to necessary background information.
For a survey paper this includes the method of how you arrived at the set of papers included in the survey.

\subsection{Formal Problem Description}
For some types of work in computer science the methodology is standard: analyze the problem (e.g., make assumptions and derive properties), present a new algorithm and its theoretical background, proving its correctness, and evaluate unproven aspects in simulation.
Then an explanation of the methodology is often omitted, and the setup of the evaluation is part of a later section on the evaluation of the ideas.\footnote{This already shows that there is no single outline to be given for all papers.}
In this case, explain relevant (background) concepts, theory and models in this section (with references) and relate them to your research question.
Also this section then typically contains a more precise, formal description of the problem.

Do not forget to give this section another name, for example after the problem you are solving.
