\begin{abstract}
The aim of this template is to make it more clear what is expected from you. 
\textbf{It is by no means required to follow this exact same structure.}
The abstract should be short and give the overall idea:
what is the background, the research questions, what are your contributions, and what are the main conclusions.
It should be readable as a stand-alone text (preferably no references to the paper or to outside literature).
