\section{Responsible Research}
Reflect on the ethical aspects of your research and discuss the reproducibility of your methods.
Note that although in many published works there is no such a section (it may be part of some meta-information collected by the journal, or part of the discussion section), we require you to think (and report) about this as part of this course.
