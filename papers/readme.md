## Paper Guide

Here you will place your (git submodule) repository for your paper. To work locally, I suggest either the [Latex-Workshop](https://github.com/James-Yu/LaTeX-Workshop/wiki/Install) VSCode plugin, or [TeXStudio](https://www.texstudio.org/) (if you *must* download a separate IDE per language). This requires you to [install a LaTeX distribution](https://www.tug.org/texlive/), if you have not done so already. 

Why make a Git repository for your paper? Firstly, the above allows you to work locally and offline. Secondly, it should help with keeping track of different versions. Thirdly, it allows you to keep a repository on your personal github account of the paper you wrote, which you deserve to show off!
