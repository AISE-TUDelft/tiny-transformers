    "Huggingface provides some powerful (and often confusingly long) APIs for model training. The `TrainingArguments` specifies our hyperparameters, which are used by the `Trainer` taking in the remaining objects (like `model`, `tokenizer`, and `train_dataset`). Specifically:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `learning_rate` and `num_train_epochs` determine how much the model learns. A higher rate is faster, but more unstable. More epochs (entire passes over the dataset) yields incrementally better results, at the cost of more training time. \n",
    "- Batch sizes determine how many samples the model sees in *parallel*. Given `gradient_accumulation_steps=1` and a `batch_size=8`, the model will backpropagate the average loss of 8 samples; if `batch_size=1`, it will average the loss of `gradient_accumulation_steps` samples. It is important to make sure the backpropagated loss is averaged over the same number of samples, when comparing models. \n",
    "\n",
    "- `data_collator` batches (and optionally, pads) the input for the model. We have already padded in our `tokenized_dataset`, and leaving this argument empty will automatically batch the inputs. So why do we need it? \n",
    "\n",
    "    Glad you asked. This has to do with how the loss is computed in causal language modelling. In our case, we try to predict $p(y | x)$, where $x$ is an input sequence of tokens, and $y$ is the next token following that sequence. Our model, unaware of the target token $y$, outputs $\\hat y$. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    For `Trainer` to compute the (cross-entropy) loss, we need to provide it with both $y$ and $\\hat y$. The `DataCollatorForLanguageModeling` knows this, and provides the next token $y$ as a separate part of the input, to the `Trainer`.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The loss is the backbone of backpropagation, which we need to actually improve our model. If this is confusing, please re-watch Karpathy's GPT tutorial. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you prefer to write the training loop yourself, check out HF' `run_clm_no_trainer.py` scripts. (`run_mlm_no_trainer.py` for RoBERTa-style masked-language modelling, as opposed to causal language modelling). This can be useful to give you better control over which devices are used for training.
