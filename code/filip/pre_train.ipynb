    "This configuration takes â¤24hr to pre-train on my M1 Macbook Air with 16GB RAM. Python takes â¤4GB VRAM at a `batch_size=16` and â¤11GB at `batch_size=64`, though they take the same amount of time to train - likely because this processor is not designed to move that much data in and out of RAM constantly. And tbh, the GPU be lacking. If you decide to go the local-training-route, consider [chai](https://github.com/lvillani/chai) to keep your (Apple) laptop awake âÂ there's probably a windows/linux equivalent too. "
