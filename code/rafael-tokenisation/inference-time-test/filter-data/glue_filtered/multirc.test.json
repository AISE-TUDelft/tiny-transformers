This would include things such as light and sound. Although forms of energy are not matter, the air and other substances they travel through are. So what is matter? Matter is defined as anything that has mass and volume. You may recall that atoms are the building blocks of matter. Even things as small as atoms have mass and volume. The more atoms, or matter, the more mass and volume are present. Different types of atoms have different amounts of mass and volume. So, its not enough to know the count of atoms to determine the mass. You must also know the type of atoms an item is made of.

So, its not enough to know the count of atoms to determine the mass. You must also know the type of atoms an item is made of. Mass and volume are just two ways to describe the physical property of a substance. Physical properties are all determined by the amounts and type of atoms that compose items.

{"paragraph": "Here is a riddle for you to ponder: What do you and a tiny speck of dust in outer space have in common? Think you know the answer? Both you and the speck of dust consist of matter. So does the ground beneath your feet. In fact, everything you can see and touch is made of matter. The only things that are not matter are forms of energy. This would include things such as light and sound. Although forms of energy are not matter, the air and other substances they travel through are. So what is matter? Matter is defined as anything that has mass and volume. You may recall that atoms are the building blocks of matter. Even things as small as atoms have mass and volume. The more atoms, or matter, the more mass and volume are present. Different types of atoms have different amounts of mass and volume. So, its not enough to know the count of atoms to determine the mass. You must also know the type of atoms an item is made of. Mass and volume are just two ways to describe the physical property of a substance. Physical properties are all determined by the amounts and type of atoms that compose items.

{"paragraph": "It was a beautiful sunny and warm day. I was working outside in my garden. I was pulling weeds which is not my favorite job, but I was enjoying the day. I live by a lake so sometimes I take a break from my chores and look at the lake. It is so beautiful and it makes me happy to look at the beautiful lake and see what animals I can find swimming in or near the lake. On this day, I kept hearing a low soft sound coming from the lake. I got up from my garden and walked to the lake. I kept hearing this strange sound. It sounded like someone talking in a very low voice. I thought it might be a lake bird because we see and hear them all of the time. The lake birds have several different calls that tell what they want to \"say\" to other lake birds. There is the call when they are flying which is very hurried and short. Then there is the \"where are you\" call which is long, slow and loud. But this sound was not like any I had ever heard. I went to get the binoculars to see if I could spot anything. But, no luck. I still kept hearing this low talking sound. I had now totally given up weeding. Finding this strange sound was going to be more fun. But where was it coming from? I looked again up and down the lake and saw nothing. Finally I went around to the other side of the place where we keep our boats. There is an area there where it is not a very deep part of the water. I spotted them! It was a mother lake bird and a father lake bird with a baby in between them. They were teaching the baby how to swim and eat fish. The low talking sound that I heard must have been them trying to teach the baby to swim and eat the fish. I sat there on the bank and watched for a half an hour.

It is so beautiful and it makes me happy to look at the beautiful lake and see what animals I can find swimming in or near the lake. On this day, I kept hearing a low soft sound coming from the lake. I got up from my garden and walked to the lake. I kept hearing this strange sound. It sounded like someone talking in a very low voice. I thought it might be a lake bird because we see and hear them all of the time. The lake birds have several different calls that tell what they want to \"say\" to other lake birds. There is the call when they are flying which is very hurried and short. Then there is the \"where are you\" call which is long, slow and loud. But this sound was not like any I had ever heard. I went to get the binoculars to see if I could spot anything. But, no luck. I still kept hearing this low talking sound. I had now totally given up weeding. Finding this strange sound was going to be more fun. But where was it coming from? I looked again up and down the lake and saw nothing. Finally I went around to the other side of the place where we keep our boats. There is an area there where it is not a very deep part of the water. I spotted them! It was a mother lake bird and a father lake bird with a baby in between them. They were teaching the baby how to swim and eat fish. The low talking sound that I heard must have been them trying to teach the baby to swim and eat the fish. I sat there on the bank and watched for a half an hour. I felt very special that I got to see this. It was such a fun thing to see and way more fun than gardening.

I got up from my garden and walked to the lake. I kept hearing this strange sound. It sounded like someone talking in a very low voice. I thought it might be a lake bird because we see and hear them all of the time. The lake birds have several different calls that tell what they want to \"say\" to other lake birds. There is the call when they are flying which is very hurried and short. Then there is the \"where are you\" call which is long, slow and loud. But this sound was not like any I had ever heard. I went to get the binoculars to see if I could spot anything. But, no luck. I still kept hearing this low talking sound. I had now totally given up weeding. Finding this strange sound was going to be more fun. But where was it coming from? I looked again up and down the lake and saw nothing. Finally I went around to the other side of the place where we keep our boats. There is an area there where it is not a very deep part of the water. I spotted them! It was a mother lake bird and a father lake bird with a baby in between them. They were teaching the baby how to swim and eat fish. The low talking sound that I heard must have been them trying to teach the baby to swim and eat the fish. I sat there on the bank and watched for a half an hour.
