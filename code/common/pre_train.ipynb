Given `gradient_accumulation_steps=1` and a `batch_size=8`, the model will backpropagate the average loss of 8 samples; if `batch_size=1`, it will average the loss of `gradient_accumulation_steps` samples. It is important to make sure the backpropagated loss is averaged over the same number of samples, when comparing models. \n",

Python takes ≤4GB VRAM at a `batch_size=16` and ≤11GB at `batch_size=64`, though they take the same amount of time to train - likely because this processor is not designed to move that much data in and out of RAM constantly. And tbh, the GPU be lacking.
